# Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition
This repository contains code for hand tracking and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The project is designed to detect and track hands in real-time using a webcam, and to recognize hand gestures for various applications, such as controlling the volume of your computer.<br>

## Features
-> Real-time hand tracking: Uses a webcam to track hands in real-time.<br>
-> Gesture recognition: Recognizes specific hand gestures to perform actions.<br>
-> Volume control: Adjusts the system volume based on hand gestures.<br>

## Project Structure
-> HandGesture.py: Contains the main hand tracking and gesture recognition code.<br>
-> VolumeControl.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for volume control using hand gestures.<br>
-> Hand_Tracking.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for experimenting with hand tracking.<br>
