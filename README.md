# Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition
This repository contains code for hand tracking and gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The project is designed to detect and track hands in real-time using a webcam, and to recognize hand gestures for various applications, such as controlling the volume of your computer.

## Features
-> Real-time hand tracking: Uses a webcam to track hands in real-time.
-> Gesture recognition: Recognizes specific hand gestures to perform actions.
-> Volume control: Adjusts the system volume based on hand gestures.

## Project Structure
-> HandGesture.py: Contains the main hand tracking and gesture recognition code.
-> VolumeControl.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for volume control using hand gestures.
-> Hand_Tracking.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for experimenting with hand tracking.

Feel free to modify this README file to suit your project's needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please open an issue in the repository. Happy coding!
